        <h3>My Interests</h3>
        
        <p>Hello class, in this paragraph I willl be talking about some of the things that I am interested in. I enjoy playing sports. In the winter I do freestlye skiing and in the spring I play box lacrosse. In the summer I really enjoy biking. In my free time I usually do experiments with computers and remote control cars. I like cooking and baking, as well as eating the food. I'm also very intersted in airplanes and flying.
